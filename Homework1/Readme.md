//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I Would like to take one of the late days to submit the completed Readme file and the final report. I have a partially working jello cube simulation and uploaded it.

Completed Parts
-> Part 1
-> Part 2
	-Euler Integration
	-Midpoint Integration
	-RK4 integration
	-computeforces
	-checkforcollisions
	-floorcollision
	-cylindercollision(able to detect contact and collision but deforms jellocube and explodes the jello cube.
	- Resolve contacts
	-resolve collisions
	-initjellomesh
->part3
	pending
-> part4
